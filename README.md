# 0h game challenge 2013

### What is it?
Super simple and incomplete side scrolling shooter.
Don't expect to win, because currently you can't.
The best you can hope for is to make it past the enemies and fly forever to the right.

Built using http://html5quintus.com/

Pretty much just lightly modified the example code.

### Controls
Up and down arrows to move, well, up and down.

Space or z to shoot

Right to boost, it's really fast.

Left does nothing, you shouldn't try to go back.
